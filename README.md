# Procedural-Landscape-Generation-with-Unity
A Unity project to generate procedural semi-realistic landscapes with textures, vegetation and water.


Opening Window in the Editor in Edit mode it is possible to find three differend windows to work on different aspects of the terrain:

- Terrain Creation Window: creates the structure of the landscape using different algorithmic techniques.
- Texture Window: add textures to the terrain.
- Environment Window: allows you to add vegetation and other details to the landscape.

After the landscape is complete and satisfying an agent can be spawned to test its navigability.
Pressing Play in the Unity Editor, the Navigation Mesh is created, and the
Spawn Button to add the Agent is placed randomly on the Navigation Surface. It starts to wander around the terrain.
